# Crossfire
This game is the result of a 5 week group project in school. It is inspired by [Spellcasters Multiplayer Duel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Tk_Games.Spellcasters). The game is made with Unity and written in C#. To run the game you need a keyboard with a numb block and you need to clone the payable-version branch and execute the crossfire.exe in the Crossfire1.0 folder.
